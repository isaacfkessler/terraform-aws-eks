# Project Documentation (Under Construction): Creating EKS Cluster using Terraform

## Introduction
This project is currently under construction and aims to create an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster on AWS using Terraform. Amazon EKS is a fully managed service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, or maintain your own Kubernetes cluster infrastructure.

This document will provide an overview of the project in its current development phase.

## Project Status
This project is in active development phase. The following steps have already been completed:
- Initial setup of development environment.
- Definition of main Terraform files.
- Structuring the project using Terraform modules.
- Definition of outputs for useful information after EKS cluster creation.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:
- AWS account with permissions to create resources like EKS clusters.
- Terraform installed locally on the development machine.

## Planned Features (Under Construction)
The following features are being implemented as part of this project:
- Configuration of EKS cluster with worker nodes.
- Definition of access and security policies.
- Setting up ingress and load balancing.
- Implementation of autoscaling policies.
- Integration with additional services like AWS Fargate.

## Execution
To execute the project in its current development phase, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Configure your AWS credentials as needed.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Execute the necessary Terraform commands to apply the configurations. Make sure to carefully review the proposed changes before confirming the application.

## Coming Soon
Future updates will be made to this document as the project progresses. We plan to add more details about the specific EKS cluster configuration, along with usage examples and troubleshooting common issues.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions, corrections, or improvements for this project, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Conclusion
This document provides an overview of the current project under construction, detailing the current status, planned features, and project structure. Keep checking back for updates as the project moves forward.
